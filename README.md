#Hello World Music V2

### Project 1 Version 2

I'm basically always listening to music (although podcasts are taking over), so I wanted to play around with sounds in my Hello World sketch. The main idea of this sketch is to let you visualize the song being played by turning the amplitude of the song into visible and recorded movement and color; when the song is louder, the shape grows and distorts slightly, and if it's loud enough the shape will change color.

In my second version, I decided to only use one song (Ex-Factor by Lauryn Hill) to make it more immersive for the viewer. I also removed all images and descriptors. I got rid of all of the functions, including changing the volume and panning with the mouse, changing the shape, and increasing or decreasing the size of the base shape. I instead made the user able to move the shape around the whole screen. I added a feature where if the music goes above a certain volume, the whole screen changes color, which makes the loudest beats of the song even more impactful. This can be turned on and off with the "h" and "n" keys. Finally, I changed the frames per second to match up with the beats per second of the song (currently the fps is 12 times the bps). What I intended this to create is a different experience of taking in music. The changing colors and size of the ellipse hopefully add another layer of entertainment, while the ability to move the circle to create new, different images using the song keep the viewer engaged through the whole song. Sometimes its nice to be able to have music on in the background, but we shouldn't forget how to really immerse ourselves in a song, especially one like this.
